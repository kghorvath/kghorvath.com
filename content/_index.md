Hi, my name is Kamin.

By day I'm a Mechanical Engineer in Atlanta, GA. By night I'm a tech enthusiast with a passion for free and open source software. I love to tinker with computers and I have a number of personal projects I'm proud to show off above.

In my free time, I enjoy gaming, home improvement, and being a dad.
