This website is hosted on a [FreeBSD](https://freebsd.org) 13.2-RELEASE server, in an [iocage](https://github.com/iocage/iocage) jail running [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/). I'm using [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) as a reverse proxy and to handle certificates from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

The website itself is built in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), using my own custom theme.
